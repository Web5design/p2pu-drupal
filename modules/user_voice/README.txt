-- SUMMARY --

UserVoice is a Customer Feedback system that makes it easy for your
users to report bugs and vote on new features.

The User Voice module allows you to easy customise the Feedback tab 
inserted by UserVoice via a settings form.

It also uses Drupal's built in Block system to allow admin users to 
easily configure who can see the UserVoice feedback button.
